/// Virtual Class to implement when integrating a stand-alone sensor into ros2_control.
/**
 * The typical examples are Force-Torque Sensor (FTS), Interial Measurement Unit (IMU).
 *
 * Methods return values have type
 * rclcpp_lifecycle::node_interfaces::LifecycleNodeInterface::CallbackReturn with the following
 * meaning:
 *
 * \returns CallbackReturn::SUCCESS method execution was successful.
 * \returns CallbackReturn::FAILURE method execution has failed and and can be called again.
 * \returns CallbackReturn::ERROR critical error has happened that should be managed in
 * "on_error" method.
 *
 * The hardware ends after each method in a state with the following meaning:
 *
 * UNCONFIGURED (on_init, on_cleanup):
 *   Hardware is initialized but communication is not started and therefore no interface is
 * available.
 *
 * INACTIVE (on_configure, on_deactivate):
 *   Communication with the hardware is started and it is configured.
 *   States can be read and non-movement hardware interfaces commanded.
 *   Hardware interfaces for movement will NOT be available.
 *   Those interfaces are: HW_IF_POSITION, HW_IF_VELOCITY, HW_IF_ACCELERATION, and HW_IF_EFFORT.
 *
 * FINALIZED (on_shutdown):
 *   Hardware interface is ready for unloading/destruction.
 *   Allocated memory is cleaned up.
 *
 * ACTIVE (on_activate):
 *   Power circuits of hardware are active and hardware can be moved, e.g., brakes are disabled.
 *   Command interfaces for movement are available and have to be accepted.
 *   Those interfaces are: HW_IF_POSITION, HW_IF_VELOCITY, HW_IF_ACCELERATION, and HW_IF_EFFORT.
